## Usage

Once a user enters the web application, they will be able to click the main red button in the middle of the page marked "Generate Password". Once clicked, multiple alerts will prompt a series of questions determining their desired criteria for their password. The user will be able to chose the following criteria: length, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. The application only requires the user to have a length between 8-128 chacters and for at least one chacter type to be selected. All other criteria are optional. Once all the prompts have been correctly answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and is displaed on the page.
